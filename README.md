Weather Forecasting Tool


Abstract:
  Weather forecasting is a crucial tool that offers useful information about the present and upcoming weather conditions. With the use of the OpenWeatherMap API, the GitHub Copilot AI assistant, and Python, this project attempts to create a weather forecasting application. The tool will be made available as a command-line interface (CLI) that will let users provide a city name as a command-line parameter. This tool will then obtain the most recent weather prediction for the chosen city from the OpenWeatherMap API. The development process will benefit from the use of GitHub Copilot, an AI-powered code completion tool. Code snippets can be generated, as well as recommendations for using APIs, processing data, resolving errors, and other things. By leveraging GitHub Copilot, developers can accelerate the development process and write more efficient and accurate code. Weather information will be retrieved via the OpenWeatherMap API. In addition to temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather descriptors, it provides a wide range of meteorological data. The data will be retrieved, interpreted, and presented to the user in an intuitive way. By giving consumers rapid access to weather data for any chosen city, this weather forecasting application will enable users to swiftly organize their activities. A robust and practical solution for weather forecasting will be produced by combining Python, GitHub Copilot, and the OpenWeatherMap API.

USAGE OF GITHUB COPILOT
Set up Development Environment:
Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any other compatible IDE that supports GitHub Copilot.
Install the GitHub Copilot extension in your IDE. This extension provides the AI-powered code completion and suggestion features.

Configure GitHub Copilot:
Once the extension is installed, you may need to sign in with your GitHub account to enable GitHub Copilot's features.
Customize the settings and preferences of GitHub Copilot according to your preferences and project requirements.

Write Code with GitHub Copilot:
As you start writing code in your project, GitHub Copilot will analyze your code and provide suggestions and completions based on the context.
GitHub Copilot will generate code snippets, function signatures, and even complete blocks of code based on the patterns and context it learns from millions of publicly available code repositories.

Utilize GitHub Copilot for API Usage:
When working with the OpenWeatherMap API, you can leverage GitHub Copilot to assist with making API requests.
GitHub Copilot may provide suggestions for structuring the API request, setting headers, handling query parameters, and processing the API response.

Leverage GitHub Copilot for Data Parsing:
GitHub Copilot can help with parsing the JSON response received from the API and extracting the desired weather information.
It may generate code snippets to handle JSON parsing, accessing nested data structures, and extracting specific fields from the response.

Benefit from GitHub Copilot for Error Handling:
GitHub Copilot can assist in generating error handling code snippets for handling potential issues during API requests or responses.
It may suggest handling network errors, invalid API responses, and other error scenarios to ensure robust error management.

Review and Validate Generated Code:
While GitHub Copilot provides helpful suggestions, it's essential to review and validate the generated code snippets.
Ensure the generated code aligns with your project requirements, follows best practices, and is free of any potential security risks or vulnerabilities.

Refine and Iterate:
Continuously refine and iterate on the code written with the help of GitHub Copilot.
Review the generated code, make necessary modifications, and enhance the logic or functionality as needed.

Result:
The below image shows the weather forecast of three different cities which consists of weather data like temperature, humidity and some weather description.
